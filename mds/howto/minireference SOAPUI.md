# Mini-reference for using SOAP-UI during eMagiz Integration realisation

SOAPUI is an tool that is often used by eMagiz users to find out the specific details of a SOAP-XML web service. SOAP-UI can be downloaded for free on this [link](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/latest-release.html), and has a wide range of capabilities.

For the specific features that are required in the context of eMagiz integration development, these are the most commonly used functions (including the links to the SOAP-UI documentation site):

  - Importing of WSDL files: https://www.soapui.org/soap-and-wsdl/getting-started.html
