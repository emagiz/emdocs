## 1. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the eMagiz platform

## 2. Key concepts
The eMagiz Store is a concept in the eMagiz platform that allows users to import reusable content into a specific ILM phase. The Store has elements for each of the model phases Capture, Design and Create, and is focused on expediting the delivery of integrations for users.

##### Theory

## 3. eMagiz Store - Introduction

### 3.1 Store for Create
The eMagiz store for the Create phase allows users to drag & drop flow fragments into the flow that requires editing. A flow fragments is a combination of 1 or more model components that together can execute a certain piece of work inside that flow. For example a file pickup that includes an archive option and specific file filters. Or the required components that are needed to send a message to a REST/JSON web service that is secured with OAuth2.0. 

The Store for the Create phase can be found in the left hand panel of the Flow designer - at the same location as where you select the model components. 

### 3.2 Store for Design
The eMagiz store for the Design phase allows to select specific operations from available systems such as Exact online, or Salesforce. So these are more datamodel oriented items and more target/source system oriented. The general idea is that you import store content whilst defining your data model message and System definitions. At that moment, you can select to import one or more message defintions. eMagiz will then guide the user to import the system message definition, as well as to import the mapping between data model and message definition. A reusable merge definition can be created between the existing data model (CDM, Gateway model or Event model) and the system definition so that the data model can be updated in a proper way.

Please note that the when the Store item is selected in this phase, the associated flow fragments for the Create phase are automatically attached to the integration. That means when the integration is transferred to Create these flow fragments will automatically be generated into the appropriate flows. eMagiz considers to put these flow fragments into the right flow depending on the type of flow fragment. 
- Connectivity flow fragments will be imported in exit gates, entry flow, event processors and exit flows
- Processing flow fragments will be imported in exit gates, event processors, offramp flows and onramp flows
- Universal flows can be imported in any flow

### 3.3 Store for Capture
The eMagiz Store will be expanded to the Capture phase in upcoming quarters. The current idea is to allow the selection of systems and integrations on level up so that the work on Design and Create becomes even more easy. Once we have made that step, we'll update this section with the right positioning.

### 3.4 Content Management for Store items
At this moment, the Store content is provided by the eMagiz team only. The concept of a company or private store is under consideration, and for now intra-company content can be moderated by the Copy-Paste functionality in the Create phase. Suggestions for new content can be send to productmanagement@emagiz.com / questions can be asked via the QA forum which may include feedback on a store item.

### 3.5 Licensing Store
Store content can be imported by any user except for store items that are licensed. For instance the Data Sink is licensed feature, and the Store item for Data Sink can only be imported in case this license is granted in the integration model.

The disclaimer for using Store content can be found here: <addlink>.
