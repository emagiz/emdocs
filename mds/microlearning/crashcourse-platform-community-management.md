In essence, we all share the responsibility to create a valuable forum for everyone that helps users. So please don't hesitate to answer questions from other users. The Q&A Forum doesn't have any Support functionalities or replace that function. We hope this forum will be of value to you.

#### 3.1.3 Turn around times 

The eMagiz team is dedicated to answering these questions within the same business day unless answered earlier by other Community users.

### 3.2 Incidents

If you have an issue with your instance that is blocking the use of the platform, and some deadlines result in pressure to have resolutions faster, you need to register an incident in our eMagiz Support Portal.

Typical examples of incidents are the non-function of critical features in eMagiz (properties, deployment, version management, etc.) that are not working. Or more significant performance issues in the eMagiz Portal prevent using key features. 

These kinds of incidents can be registered at https://support.emagiz.com/ and are handled by the eMagiz Support team. You would need to be registered as a user in the Support Portal. At the start of eMagiz, one or more users are registered in that Portal, which is allowed to register tickets. Specific guidance in which tickets should be registered is located in the Portal itself.

The eMagiz Support team is dedicated to resolving your incident and is in direct contact with eMagiz Expert Services in case needed. Please consult your eMagiz SLA owner in your organization to understand specific agreements in place around response times.


### 3.3 Improvements

While using the platform, you may notice more minor-like feedbacks you will have. For example, the specific behavior of the functionalities offered is not exactly working as expected yet does not result in an incident. Furthermore, you may have specific ideas for improving the use of the platform. 

These kinds of improvements - minor feedback and minor issues - can be registered via the eMagiz iPaaS Portal itself by using the feedback button located on the right-hand side. By simply pressing the button, you make your comment or suggestion. What's very handy in this process is that you can take a screenshot of the page where you are located to illustrate the issue. This will help us resolve your feedback quicker.

The eMagiz product management team frequently reviews the incoming feedback and makes short comments towards fixing these items. We are dedicated to resolving these issues for you. Some of these feedback items might be larger in effort and take longer before being resolved. Others may be fixed in an upcoming release. eMagiz will make discretionary decisions on these items.


### 3.4 Notice

The eMagiz Portal is only accessible for authenticated & authorized users of eMagiz clients. Users can decide what information to upload into the QA Forum, Support Portal, or Feedback button and whatnot. The use of pictures and other information from the platform is beneficial and advised. Please read our privacy policy at https://www.emagiz.com/privacy-policy/.
